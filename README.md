Snake Game:
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around a rectangular grid. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food items that appear on the screen while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making movement more challenging as the game progresses.

Gameplay Features
Movement: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard arrow keys or touch controls.

Growth: Eating food increases the snake’s length, making navigation more difficult.

Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the screen’s borders or its own body.

Score System: Players earn points for each piece of food eaten. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score before losing.

Game Variants
Classic Mode: The snake dies upon hitting a wall or itself.

Boundary Mode: Some versions allow the snake to pass through walls and appear on the opposite side.

Multiplayer Mode: Some versions feature multiple snakes competing for food.

The Snake Game remains popular due to its simplicity and addictive gameplay. It has been recreated in various forms, including mobile apps, browser-based versions, and coding tutorials for beginners learning programming concepts.
